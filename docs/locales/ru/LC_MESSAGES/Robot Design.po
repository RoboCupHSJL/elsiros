"Standard robot proto used for simulation is Robokit1.proto. It is "
"designed as virtual copy of real robot. In order to represent real robot "
"all technical features of virtual model were copied from technical "
"description of real robot including servo torque, servo speed, servo "
"mass, location of camera, camera resolution, aperture of camera lens, "
"number and location of accelerometers, weight distribution throughout of "

"Virtual model has 2 IMUs named \"imu_head\" and \"imu_body\". Real robot "
"is capable to recognize coordinate of itself at soccer field with "
"accuracy ±15cm, it is capable to recognize obstacles and ball. "
"Recognition of distance and course to ball and obstacles is made through "
"machine vision algorithms. Robot detectds distance and course to object "
"with accuracy mainly dependent on camera accuracy. Good calibrated robot "
"detects course to object with accuracy ± 0.01 Radian. Accuracy of "
"distance recognition non-linearly depends on distance to object, with "
"best accuracy at minimum distances which is ± 5mm. Distance measurement "
"accuracy at distance 1m is ± 25mm, at distance 2m is ± 100mm High "
"accuracy of distance and course measurement are provided due to equipment"
" and smart algotihms used for direct measurements. Localization on soccer"
" field is provided by measurements of cource and distence to goal posts, "
"field marking, green field border, odometry, measurement of IMU. All "
"localization data is accumulated with historical data and processed by "
"patricle filter algorithm in order to achieve better accuracy than "
"measurement of individual object. Simulation procedure in Webots is "
"orgaised in way when simulation of physics and motion is provided "
"together with camera image scanning. Procedure of image scanning and "
"transfer to outside from Webots greatly reduces simulation speed. In "
"order to keep simulation speed at acceptable rate it was decided to skip "
"procedure of scanning images by camera in simulation and replace it with "
"direct request- report procedure. Following data are reported to Robokit1"
" robot from simulation by request: distance and course from robot to "
"ball, distance and course from robot to other players, self coordinate "
"and orientation on field. Requested data before reporting to robot are "
"mixed with random values in order to provide same accuracy which usually "
"real robot detects from camera image. Above procedure is called "
"\"blurrer\". Above procedure provide increasing is simulation speed up to"
" 10 times. This know-how of ELSIROS provides games to be played at laptop"
" computer with nearly realtime speed."
