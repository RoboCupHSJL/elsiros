"Let’s try to change strategy of “forward” role using matrix stored "
"strategy_data.json. If you launch first game which was supplied in "
"installation package you may notice that red player 2  is granted first "
"kick off. According to rule player which is not granted kick off is not "
"allowed to enter  central circle within 10 seconds after game start "
"therefore blue player 2 stands outside of central  circle.  Red player 2 "
"kicks ball directly to blue player 2. Direction of kick is not "
"beneficiary in this case.  It makes sense to change kick direction. There"
" are several ways to change kick direction. Here we  consider how to "
"change it using strategy matrix."
